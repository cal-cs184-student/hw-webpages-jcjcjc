		<h2>Overview</h2>
		In this homework, we explored the rasterization pipeline, and built one that is capable of rendering 
		triangles, transformations, and texture mapping. We first implemented basic triangle rasterization, and used
		point-in-triangle tests to determine if sample points lie inside or outside the triangle. Then, we built upon
		this in Task 2 by implementing supersampling for antialiasing. We learned how to eliminate jaggies in our renders
		and produce a smoother, more realistic looking result. To enable hierarchical transforms, we ventured into implementing 2D
		transformations (scale, rotate, translate). We then explored barycentric coordinates, allowing us to smoothly interpolate 
		vertex attributes, like color, across the points inside the triangle and later applied this concept to texture mapping
		in Task 5, where we applied barycentric interpolation to texture coordinates instead of colors. Ultimately, we were
		able to complete the texture pipeline with mipmapping and level sampling. 

		<p>This homework disclosed the intricate techniques to displaying graphics on the computer screen, something that 
			we usually just take advantage of. We were able to interact with and build upon the pipeline from end-to-end, which 
			was really cool. We thought that it was interesting how each task stacked on top of each other, and how all of them
			worked together to produce a smoother, more realistic final image.
		</p>
		<h2>Task 1: Drawing Single-Color Triangles</h2>
		<p>To rasterize triangles, we first find the coordinates of the corners of the 
			bounding box of our triangle, ensuring that these corner coordinates 
			fall within our viewport. For every pixel in that bounding box, we sample the
			 center of that pixel. We determine whether the sample point lies inside the 
			 triangle using the three line tests and line equations shown in lecture 2. 
			 If the point is inside or on a boundary/edge of the triangle, then we fill that 
			 pixel in with the given color.</p>
		<p>Our algorithm is no worse than one that checks each sample within the bounding 
		box of the triangle, since that is exactly what our algorithm does.</p>

		<h2>Task 3: Transforms</h2>
		Cubeman is doing the splits! We rotated and translated the rectangles that form Cubeman's legs to make him a gymnast.

		For extra credit, we added a viewport rotation feature to the GUI. Clicking "J" will rotate the viewport 5 degrees clockwise, and clicking "K" will rotate the viewport 5 degrees counterclockwise. Clicking the space key will reset to the original viewport with no rotation.
		<figure>
			<img src="task3ec.png" alt="task3ec" style="width:50%"/>
		</figure>
		To implement this feature, we inserted a rotation transform into the SVG-to-screen matrix stack. To rotate around the scene's center rather than the top left, the logical transformation steps are: translate SVG center to origin, rotate, translate back, convert SVG to NDC, and then convert NDC to screen. In code, the matrix transformation chain is "backwards" since matrix multiplication is carried out from right to left.
		
		<h2>Task 4: Barycentric coordinates</h2>
		Barycentric coordinates are when we describe a point's position 
		inside a triangle as a weighted combination of the three vertices of 
		that triangle. Each point can be represented by 3 coordinates, one for 
		each vertex, and the calculated weights essentially tell us "how much" of 
		that vertex influences the point. 

		<figure>
			<img src="rgb_triangle.png" alt="rgb" style="width:50%"/>
		</figure>

		For example, if &alpha; corresponds to the red vertex, then a point 
		closer to the red vertex will have a higher &alpha; value (closer to 1.0), 
		while &beta; and &gamma; will be smaller (approaching 0.0). At the red vertex 
		itself, &alpha; = 1 and &beta; = &gamma; = 0. We then use these values to calculate
		the final color of that point.Therefore, a point closer to the red vertex 
		would be colored more red than the other two colors, and vice versa for any 
		of the other colors.

		<h2>Task 5: "Pixel sampling" for texture mapping</h2>
		Pixel Sampling is the process of determining what color a pixel should be given using 
		a texture image, including when the sample point doesn't land exactly on a texel center.

		<p>In our implementation, we first follow a similar structure for rasterizing triangles to ensure
			that a given point is inside the triangle. Then, we compute the (u, v) texture coordinates for the given point
			using barycentric interpolation. This is similar to what we did when interpolating color in Task 4,
			but instead of interpolating color, we are interpolating the texture coordinates for this task. Because
			this mapped pixel usually does not land perfectly on a texel in the texture map, we need ways
			to sample the texture at arbitrary positions. 
		</p>

		<p><b>Nearest neighbor sampling: </b>this method of sampling simply rounds to the closest 
			texel. We convert the continuous (u, v) coordinate to discrete texel indices 
			by multiplying by the texture dimensions and rounding down.</p>

		<p><b>Bilinear sampling: </b>this method of sampling considers the 
			four texels surrounding the sample point and blends them based 
			on the distance of the sample point from each texel center. We first interpolate 
			horizontally between the two top texels and the two bottom texels, then interpolate vertically 
			between those results using a total of three lerps.
		</p>

			<table style="width: 100%; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;">
			  <tr>
				<td style="text-align: center;">
				  <img src="nearest_default_tex.png" width="400px"/>
				  <figcaption>Nearest on 1x</figcaption>
				</td>
				<td style="text-align: center;">

				  <figcaption>Nearest on 16x</figcaption>
				</td>
			  </tr>
			  <tr>

				  <img src="bilinear_default_tex.png" width="400px"/>
				  <figcaption>Bilinear on 1x</figcaption>
				</td>
				<td style="text-align: center;">
				  <img src="bilinear_16_tex.png" width="400px"/>
				  <figcaption>Bilinear on 16x</figcaption>
				</td>
			  </tr>
			</table>
		</div>

		<p>We can see that when sampling at 1 sample per pixel,
			nearest neighbor sampling produces some aliasing in the windows
			of the campanile. There appears to be darker spots underneath the window
			whereas there are less of these spots and an overall more blurred appearance when using bilinear sampling at the same rate.
			When sampling at 16 samples per pixel, however, the results are pretty
			similar. Both methods of sampling have reduced or entirely erased aliasing.
			In general, there might be a larger difference between the two sampling methods if the texture 
    		is being magnified, since bilinear more smoothly interpolates between texels 
    		while nearest tends to produce more blocky results.
		</p>

		<h2>Task 6: "Level Sampling" with mipmaps for texture mapping</h2>
		Level sampling is choosing which resolution of a texture to sample from based on how big that texture appears on screen. If a textured triangle is very small or far away, sampling from the full-resolution image causes aliasing and generally looks bad, so we instead sample from a lower-resolution mip level.
		In our implementation, we estimated how much the UV coordinates change across one pixel using derivatives by sampling at (x+1, y) and (x, y+1). We used that to compute the scale factor and took log base 2 to get the appropriate mip level. 
		We implemented two methods: picking the nearest mip level and linearly interpolating between two mip levels (trilinear texture filtering).
